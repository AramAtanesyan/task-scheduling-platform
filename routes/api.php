| API Routes

| Here is where you can register API routes for your application. These
| routes are loaded by the RouteServiceProvider within a group which
| is assigned the "api" middleware group. Enjoy building your API!
|
| Note: For this SPA application, API routes are defined in web.php
| to use session-based authentication. This file is kept for future
| external API endpoints that might use token-based authentication.
